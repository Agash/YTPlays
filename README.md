## :star2: About the Project

So Frank ([Astroid Videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AstroidmaniaVideos)) had some fun ideas for streams with chat. I thought I'd implement those. He actually got a couple of people helping him out, so I took the time to fix up a GUI (still messy code tho). It can do TwitchPlays style chat control with 3 modes (democracy, monarchy, anarchy) and also let chat type pokemon names, another great stream from Frank (also coding detours are always fun to watch).

This project wouldn't be possible without the amazing YouTube.js library, since YouTube's API is useless for these use cases.
